1. Student Edstem Post - Lab 7 ListExamples.java failure

For lab7 whenever I run my tests for the merge method in ListExamples.java using the bash script test.sh, both of my tests fail with this failure message. I also attached my code for my merge method and was hoping someone could help me figure out this bug. 

2. TA response
Take a closer look at your failure messages, do you see anything that could help you figure out what is going on. Is this a bug or a failure in your code.
